Questions

For biovars
1) What are the unique domain architectures? What are common domain architectures? Vein diagram.

2) heat map most abundant domains

3) heat map most abundant architecture

4) number of common and unique domains

5) number of common and unique architectures

for each strains
1) what is the domain coverage of proteins ?

2) heat map compare domain profiles
Strain 1 - D1, D2, ..., DN
Strain 2 - D1, D2, ..., DN

To compute domain profile we can compute pearson correlation et/ou euclidian distance

2) heat map to compare architecture profiles
Strain 1 - A1, A2, ..., Am
Strain 2 - A1, A2, ..., Am

3) How many proteins are multi-domain (more then one domain)?
